## Implementation Approach
The implementation of the driverless car software will involve creating Python classes corresponding to the defined class diagram. 

Each class will be responsible for specific functionalities such as capturing images, detecting obstacles, making decisions, and storing data. The code will be organised, well-commented, and adhere to the best coding practices to ensure readability and maintainability.

## Data Structure Choice
Additionally, to enhance the efficiency of processing the data collected during the operation, the following data structures are chosen in this implementation: 

#### Lists: 

Lists are utilised to store collections of data, such as images captured by the camera and raw data collected from various sensors. 

#### Dictionaries: 

Dictionaries are chosen to store key-value pairs, facilitating efficient lookup and retrieval of data. Its characteristic will be useful for organising and accessing data related to obstacle detection results, decision-making outcomes, and other system parameters.

#### Stacks and Queues: 

While not directly utilised in this implementation, stacks and queues could be integrated as needed for specific functionalities. 

The choice of these data structures is based on their suitability for handling the diverse data types and requirements of the driverless car software.

## Testing Approach

The implemented code will be thoroughly tested to ensure its correctness and functionality. 

Testing will include unit tests for individual methods as well as integration tests to verify the interactions between different components.

Python's assert statement will be used for automated testing, along with additional testing techniques as deemed necessary.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this assignment aims to implement the software components required to support the operation of a driverless car. 

By adhering to the provided class diagram, choosing appropriate data structures, and following best coding practices, the implemented software is expected to effectively capture images, detect obstacles, make decisions, and store data, thereby contributing to the advancement of driverless car technology.
