## System Design
>https://github.com/shur94/ePortfolio/tree/main/Implementation%20(Week%2011)

Assignment was to design a software to support driverless car.

As instructed, I have designed a software to assist the process of 'recognition of obstacles and logical decision of stopping the car'.

</br>
With references from various materials, I have completed designing on the basis of backgrounds as below:

- Use Case Diagram: to present foundtaional architecure of the software

- Class Diagram: to present data types and classes that will be used in the software

- Activity Diagram: to represent the flow of activities to illustrate the software's behaviour

</br>
Although the final piece of the design still lacks many details that could have been used to improve, the design was created to progres

### Self assessment
#### 1. Overall
With given feedback and grade, the initial design lack of completed tasks.

Considering the quality of findings, the expertise to a certain level is not achieved, and it clearly needs to improve.

#### 2. Understanding
Even though I cited and referred some external knowledge, it cannot be confidently said that those were correctly implemented in my work.

Since I lack fundamental knowledge, which partially were satisfied through previous modules, I may needed more time and effort to follow up such scarcity.

However, I tried to simplify the whole process, which eventually became a final design that can be compiled as python codes.

### System Implementation
https://github.com/shur94/ePortfolio/tree/main/System%20Design%20(Week%207)

Next assignment was to build a software to support driverless car, based on system design that was previously submitted.

As instructed, I have completed coding process (python) for a software.

</br>
Again, with references from various materials, following two codings are created:

#### 1. driverless_system.py

It consists of several classes that simulate the functionality of a driverless car system with classes, of which details can be accessed via README of the project:

#### DriverlessSystem:
This class represents the main system controlling the driverless car.

#### Camera:

This class represents the camera module of the driverless car.

#### Data:
This class represents the data storage module of the driverless car.

#### Obstacle:
This class represents the obstacle detection module of the driverless car.

#### Decision:
This class represents the decision-making module of the driverless car.


#### 2. test_driverless_system.py

It consists the testing code using the unittest(Python, n.d.) framework to test the functionality of the driverless car system.

Similarly, details can be accessed via README of this project

#### test_make_decision: 
Tests the make_decision method of the DriverlessSystem class. 

#### test_detect_obstacle: 
Tests the detect_obstacle method of the DriverlessSystem class.

#### test_store_data: 
Tests the store_data method of the DriverlessSystem class.

### Self assessment
#### 1. Overall
Although the design lacked essential details, the final outcome does work as I intended.

The final code is very simplified with very basic logical decisions for the car to decide, however, it provides satisfying decision making process with the given situation of simulating the image.

#### 2. Understanding
Even though I cited and referred some external knowledge, it cannot be confidently said that those were correctly implemented in my work.

Since I lack fundamental knowledge, which partially were satisfied through previous modules, I may needed more time and effort to follow up such scarcity.

However, I tried to simplify the whole process, which eventually became a final design that can be compiled as python codes.
