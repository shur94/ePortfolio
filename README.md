This is a portfolio to present my learning outcomes from Object Oriented Programming module.

## System Design
>https://github.com/shur94/ePortfolio/tree/main/Implementation%20(Week%2011)

The assignment was to design a software to support driverless cars.

As instructed, I have designed software to assist the process of 'recognition of obstacles and logical decision of stopping the car'.

</br>
With references from various materials, I have completed designing based on backgrounds as below:

- Use Case Diagram: to present the foundational architecture of the software

- Class Diagram: to present data types and classes that will be used in the software

- Activity Diagram: to represent the flow of activities to illustrate the software's behaviour

</br>
Although the final piece of the design still lacks many details that could have been used to improve, the design was created to progress.

### Self-assessment
#### 1. Overall
With feedback and grade, the initial design lack of completed tasks.

Considering the quality of findings, the expertise to a certain level is not achieved, and it needs to improve.

#### 2. Understanding
Even though I cited and referred to some external knowledge, it cannot be confidently said that those were correctly implemented in my work.

Since I lack fundamental knowledge, which partially were satisfied through previous modules, I may needed more time and effort to fill up such scarcity.

However, I tried to simplify the whole process, which eventually became a final design that can be compiled as Python codes.

### System Implementation
https://github.com/shur94/ePortfolio/tree/main/System%20Design%20(Week%207)

The next assignment was to build software to support driverless cars, based on system design that was previously submitted.

As instructed, I have completed the coding process (python) for a software.

</br>
Again, with references from various materials, following two codings are created:

#### 1. driverless_system.py

It consists of the testing code using the unittest(Python, n.d.) framework to test the functionality of the driverless car system.

#### DriverlessSystem:
This class represents the main system controlling the driverless car.

#### Camera:

This class represents the camera module of the driverless car.

#### Data:
This class represents the data storage module of the driverless car.

#### Obstacle:
This class represents the obstacle detection module of the driverless car.

#### Decision:
This class represents the decision-making module of the driverless car.


#### 2. test_driverless_system.py

It consists the testing code using the unittest(Python, n.d.) framework to test the functionality of the driverless car system.

Similarly, details can be accessed via README of this project

#### test_make_decision: 
Tests the make_decision method of the DriverlessSystem class. 

#### test_detect_obstacle: 
Tests the detect_obstacle method of the DriverlessSystem class.

#### test_store_data: 
Tests the store_data method of the DriverlessSystem class.

### Self-assessment
#### 1. Overall
Although the design lacked essential details, the outcome did work as I intended.

The final code is very simplified with very basic logical decisions for the car to decide, however, it provides a satisfying decision-making process with the given situation of simulating the image.

#### 2. Understanding
Based on the system design, I executed the coding process successfully, even if the outcome could not reach a certain level to present expertise enough.

As it was coded based on the simplified design, there were only a few difficulties to overcome, which then were acquired from external sources.

To conclude, considering how simplified the design was, I presented the intention of the design well.

However, if the design consisted the better knowledge and understanding, the final software presentation also could be better.
